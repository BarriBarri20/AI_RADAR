# AI News Radar

This is a Django application that was created by Your Name for the AI_NIGHT_CHALLENGE competition. The application scrapes AI news from different websites asynchronously. The application uses **Selenium**, **Redis**, **MySQL**, **Scrapy**, and **Celery** to scrape news articles from various sources and store them in a database. The application is characterized by date and search, and it uses ***Tailwind CSS*** for styling.

### Usage

The application automatically scrapes AI news from different websites every 20 seconds. You can also manually trigger the scraping process by clicking the "Scrape Now" button on the home page. The scraped news articles are displayed on the home page and are searchable by date and keyword.

With the ability to categorize fields by their unique HTML tags, you can easily scrape news articles from other websites and add them to the application. Additionally, it's possible to scrape from other websites as well. The key is to invest time in figuring out how to categorize the fields of each article based on their unique HTML tag.
